===== Example: Falling sphere using RK4 =====
label{example:falling_sphere_RK4}

Let's implement the RK4 scheme and use it on (ref{ex:falling_sphere}). The scheme has been implemented in the function `rk4()`, and is given below

@@@CODE ./chapter1/programs_and_modules/ODEschemes.py from-to:# define rk4 scheme@return z

Figure ref{fig:falling_sphere_euler_heun_rk4} shows the results using Euler, Heun and RK4. AS seen, RK4 and Heun are more accurate than Euler. The complete programme _FallingSphereEulerHeunRK4.py_ is listed below. The functions `euler`, `heun` and `rk4` are imported from the programme _ODEschemes.py_.
